Project Name: EC558 – Network Traffic Forecasting and Anomaly Detection (Classical ML)

Description:
This project uses classical machine learning methods to analyze network traffic data.
The main goals are:

Forecast the next time-step network traffic speed using historical data and time-based features.

Detect anomalous traffic behavior (e.g. sudden spikes or drops) based on model residuals and/or unsupervised anomaly detection.
